description: "I hope you speak what’s on your mind, that you raise your voice for injustice, that you tell others that you love them"

Life is too short to wonder what could have been, or to waste time chasing the wrong things.  
 I hope you find reasons to be happy, big or small, and carry those with you wherever you go.  
I hope you stop worrying about things you can’t control or people you can’t change.  
I hope you speak words of kindness to yourself and to others.  
From this moment on,


I hope you’re happier,live louder,laugh more and sing at the top of your lungs.  
I hope you drive with the windows down and let the wind rustle through your hair.  
I hope you surround yourself with people who make you feel alive.  
I hope you become the type of person that brings good energy wherever you go, and the type of person people want to be around.  
I hope you speak what’s on your mind, that you raise your voice for injustice, that you tell others that you love them,  
instead of waiting until it’s too late. I hope you live louder, shine brighter.  
From this moment on
