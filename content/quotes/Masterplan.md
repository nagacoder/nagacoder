"Master plans have two additional unhealthy characteristics. To begin with, the existence of a master plan alienates the users ... After all, the very existence of a master plan means by definition, that the members of the community can have little impact on the future shape of their community, because most of the important decisions have already been made. In a sense, under a master plan people are living with a frozen future, able to affect only relatively trivial details. When people lose the sense of responsibility for the environment they live in, and realize that they are merely cogs in someone elseâ€™s machine, how can they feel any sense of identification with the community, or any sense of purpose there?"
