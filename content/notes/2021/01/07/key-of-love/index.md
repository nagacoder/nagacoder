I think the key to staying in love, is staying grateful. When you have something and someone good, don’t go looking for something better.

Learn to appreciate what you have. Learn that the best relationships are the ones where you don’t give up on each other. We are living in a generation where it’s easy to move on and give up when things get hard. Don’t do that. Cherish what you have.

Be that story that says - we made it all the way, and that’s because we never gave up on each other, or walked away from the love we found.

We made it all the way because we reminded ourselves, every single day, just how lucky we really were..
