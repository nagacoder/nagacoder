It is okay to take a break. If you start feeling stressed,cry a lot, feel uncomfortable in social situations, eat too much or even too little cannot handle talking to anyone because it is too exhausting or as if your world is just crumbling,then take a step back and take care of yourself.

Yes, I know, you need to hand in that assignment,study for that important test, go to work because you need the money and drag yourself to places you do not want to be at just because you have to.

But remember that you are the most important thing in your life.  
 And if you keep pushing through things that will only make you feel more miserable,  
 you will not feel better.

So, take a day off, push every responsibilty aside and relax,  
 for you deserve it so much. You have been holding on for so long and I am so proud of you.  
 Please reward yourself by spending time alone (or with loved ones) in comfortable clothes, with a lot of snacks and a good TV show.
